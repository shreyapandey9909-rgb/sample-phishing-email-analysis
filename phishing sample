 Phishing Analysis — sample-phish-1

Source observed (display): MS Outlook Support <info@outlook-support.dk>  
Displayed link: https://www.account.live.com  
Urgent text quoted:** "Your Hotmail Account services has expired." / "Sign in Re-activate your account"

Phishing traits found
- Sender domain `outlook-support.dk` is not an official Microsoft domain → possible spoofing.
- Display link appears to be Microsoft but may be mismatched (actual href must be copied & inspected).
- Urgent, threatening language to force quick action.
- Grammar and spelling errors present ("services has expired") — not consistent with corporate messaging.
- Visual impersonation (Outlook logo + Microsoft styling).

 Evidence to attach
- `sample-phish-1.eml` (raw message, sanitized)
- `headers.txt` (full Received / Authentication-Results lines)
- `links.md` (list of display URLs and actual hrefs)
- `screenshots/hover_screenshot.png` (hover screenshot showing actual URL)

 Recommended actions
1. Quarantine and block the sending domain.
2. Submit suspected URLs to VirusTotal / URLscan.io.
3. If someone interacted with the message, force password reset and enable MFA.
4. Report sample to organizational SOC and to anti-phishing services.

Risk rating: HIGH — impersonation + credential theft vector expected.
